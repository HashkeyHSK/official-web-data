## HashKey Chain Unlocks Cross-Chain Future with Chainlink CCIP Integration

HashKey Chain has officially enabled cross-chain functionality for its native token HSK by adopting Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and the Cross-Chain Token Standard (CCT). This milestone marks a major leap in utility and reach for the HashKey ecosystem, introducing wHSK, the wrapped version of HSK now bridged to leading chains like Arbitrum and Base.

With CCIP as the canonical bridge, HashKey Chain is now connected to Chainlink’s battle-tested, enterprise-grade cross-chain infrastructure—delivering enhanced security, programmability, and zero-slippage transfers for developers and institutions building next-generation financial applications.

## How to Get and Use wHSK
1. Get wHSK
   Swap native HSK to wHSK at a 1:1 ratio via HyperIndex. The swap takes place on HashKey Chain and confirms directly to your wallet.
